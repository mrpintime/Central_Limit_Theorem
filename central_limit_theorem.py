Theorem_Description = """
The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean $$Î¼$$ and standard deviation $$Ïƒ$$ and take 
sufficiently large random samples from the population with replacement, then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.

         1. Choose your distribution for sampling
         2. Define size of your sample
         3. Sample from your distribution several times

st.markdown("""
> **Hypothesis Testing**: CLT is often used in hypothesis testing. When dealing with sample means, you can assume that the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal. This allows you to perform hypothesis tests and calculate confidence intervals.

> **Quality Control**: In manufacturing and production processes, companies often take random samples of products to assess quality. By applying the CLT, they can make inferences about the population's quality based on the sample means.

> **A/B Testing**: In digital marketing, A/B testing is used to compare the performance of two or more versions of a webpage, advertisement, or product feature. The CLT is used to analyze the results and determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the groups.

> **Risk Assessment**: In risk management, businesses assess various risks, such as operational, market, and credit risks. The CLT can be used to model the distribution of potential losses and make risk management decisions. 

Some extra usages are :
**Inventory Management**, **Credit Scoring**, **Customer Satisfaction Surveys**, **Market Research**
            
In all these cases, **The Central Limit Theorem** provides a solid foundation for making statistical inferences and decisions based on sample data. It allows businesses to draw conclusions about populations, make predictions, and make data-driven decisions, which are crucial for effective operations and decision-making.
